# Image Embedding and Retrieval System

This repository contains three Python scripts (`Embedding.py`, `Traditional.py`, and `VectorDatabase.py`) that are used for generating image embeddings, processing images, and querying against a vector database. These scripts can be used together to create an image retrieval system based on embeddings.

## Files Overview

### 1. Embedding.py
This script is responsible for generating image embeddings using the OpenCLIP embedding function. The main functionalities include:
- **`get_single_image_embedding(image)`**: Converts a single image into an embedding using the OpenCLIP model.
- **`read_image_from_path(path, size)`**: Reads an image from a specified file path, converts it to RGB, and resizes it.
- **`folder_to_images(folder, size)`**: Processes all images in a specified folder into embeddings.

### 2. Traditional.py
This script focuses on traditional image processing methods and plotting the results of image queries. The key functions include:
- **`read_image_from_path(path, size)`**: Similar to the function in `Embedding.py`, it reads and resizes an image.
- **`plot_results(query_path, ls_path_score, reverse)`**: Plots the results of an image query, displaying the query image alongside the most similar images from a dataset.

### 3. VectorDatabase.py
This script is designed to integrate with a vector database (using `chromadb`) and perform image retrieval based on embeddings. The main components include:
- **`plot_results(image_path, files_path, results)`**: Plots the query image and its closest matches from a vector database.
- **`embedding_search(...)`**: Uses embeddings to perform similarity searches within a vector database.

## Getting Started
